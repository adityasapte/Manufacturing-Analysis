# 🏭 Manufacturing Production Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **Manufacturing Production Analysis Dashboard** developed using Excel/Power BI to monitor, analyze, and optimize production performance. The dashboard provides key insights into manufacturing quantity, rejected quantity, wastage, employee performance, and machine efficiency.

The goal of this project is to help stakeholders identify production gaps, reduce rejection rates, improve operational efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Track overall production performance
* Monitor rejected and wastage quantities
* Analyze employee-wise rejection trends
* Evaluate machine-wise performance
* Compare manufacturing vs rejection trends over time
* Identify high-performing and low-performing departments

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Included

* ✅ Total Manufactured Quantity
* ❌ Total Rejected Quantity
* ⚙️ Total Processed Quantity
* ♻️ Wastage Quantity
* 👨‍🏭 Employee-wise Rejected Quantity
* 🏗️ Machine-wise Rejected Quantity
* 📈 Production Trend Analysis
* 📊 Manufacture vs Rejected Comparison
* 🏢 Department-wise Performance Analysis
